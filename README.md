# dockerbackendchallenge

1. Take an existing API (used the poke-api for this)
2. Build a docker-based API proxy around it.
3. Add a RESTful database resource to that API supplementing the original (used Mongo).
4. Add HTTP authentication to it (JWT).
5. Deploy the app (Google Cloud build trigger and Kubernetes cluster).
6. Load-test it
7. Build a cache strategy and show how it improves performance of the system.
